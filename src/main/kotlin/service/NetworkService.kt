 * the local player. Incoming messages are decoded by the [NetworkService] and delegated to
 * the appropriate components of the service layer, e.g. incoming tile placement messages
 * will cause [PlayerActionService.playerMove] to be called. Because the [NetworkService] delegates
 * all events to other parts of the service layer it does not need to implement [AbstractRefreshingService]
 * itself, all relevant callbacks will be invoked from either [RootService] or [PlayerActionService].
